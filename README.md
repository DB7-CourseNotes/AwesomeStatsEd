# AwesomeStatsEd

A curated, opinionated list of Open Education Resources (especially software tools) for statistics and data science education. 

I am currently in the very early stages. Feel free to contribute resources via Issues, Pull Requests, or email (if you manage snail mail me a hand-written link to an OER resource, I will buy you a coffee).

# Software Tools/Packages/Templates

- [Quarto Course Notes](httpe://github.com/DB7-CourseNotes/QuorseNotes) demonstrates a way to compile quarto slides into an online textbook.
- [webR](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/)
    - See [here](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/nrennie/teaching-with-webR/blob/main/index.html#/adding-webr-to-teaching-materials-1) for simple instructions for using in a quarto document (especially a textbook).

# Open Courses/Textbooks
