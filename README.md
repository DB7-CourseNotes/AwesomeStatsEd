# AwesomeStatsEd

A curated, opinionated list of Open Education Resources (especially software tools) for statistics and data science education. 

I am currently in the very early stages. Feel free to contribute resources via Issues, Pull Requests, or email (if you manage snail mail me a hand-written link to an OER resource, I will buy you a coffee).

Legend:

- :1st_place_medal: means that the material is shared via Creative Commons Share-Alike, MIT,  or similar.
    - I include non-commercial in this since use in courses falls under non-commercial use.
- :2nd_place_medal: means that the material has some restrictions, such as CC NoDerivatives. 
- Resources without a medal mean I do not know their license, but they are on this list because they do offer to share resources.

# Software Tools/Packages/Templates

- :1st_place_medal: [Quarto Course Notes](httpe://github.com/DB7-CourseNotes/QuorseNotes) demonstrates a way to compile quarto slides into an online textbook.
    - Note that this is my repo, and you're welcome to ignore my self-promotion.
- :1st_place_medal: [webR](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/)
    - See [here](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/nrennie/teaching-with-webR/blob/main/index.html#/adding-webr-to-teaching-materials-1) for simple instructions for using in a quarto document (especially a textbook).

# Open Courses/Textbooks

-  :1st_place_medal: [Data Science in a Box](https://github.com/tidyverse/datascience-box/tree/main)includes lessons based on R (which is run on their Shiny instance).
    - [Here](https://datasciencebox.org/) it is in action!
    - Potential project: port from Shiny to webR.
- :1st_place_medal: [Introduction to Modern Statistics](https://github.com/OpenIntroStat/ims) is a Quarto-based textbook that highlights simulation-based inference.
    - [Here](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/) it is in action!
    - Potential project: turn into slides.
- :1st_place_medal: [Penn State Statistics Courses](https://online.stat.psu.edu/statprogram/graduate-programs) include their online course notes, e.g. for [Stat 501: Regression Analysis](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat501/).
 
# Miscellaneous

- CAUSEWEB has lots of great things (but lots of link rot)

# Open Data

- [Teaching DEIJ-Infused Biostatistics](https://nwakim.github.io/teaching_biostats/datasets.html) is an individual effort to gather culturally relevant datasets, with a full discussion of the EDI components. (Work in progress - deserves some support!)

# Free (but Closed Source or Restrictive License) Courses/Textbooks

- [Passion Driven Statistics](https://ldierker1.github.io/passiondrivenstatistics/) is a project based intro to stats.
